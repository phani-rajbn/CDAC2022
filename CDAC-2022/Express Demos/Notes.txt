Express is an additional node package available for Nodejs developers to create rich internet apps with less effort. It internally uses HTTP Module and gives a better set of APIS to create web apps in much faster and reliable manner. Express is a superset of HTTP. Express is available in Node Package Manager, a repository of all third party packages that are distributed to the node developers free of cost. 
U too as a developer can create packages and distrubute it to the community. 
Express is good for Web App development, REST API development and many other internet based app developments. 
REST API is a set of functions that are exposed to the developers in the form of HTTP URLs. Programmers using their own programming technology can access these URLs and extract data(HTTP GET), post data(HTTP POST), remove data(HTTP DELETE) and update data(HTTP PUT).

Java has Spring boot framework for creating REST API in Java
C# has Web API for creating REST API in .NET 
PHP also has features to create REST API in it. 
NODE.JS has EXPRESS to create REST API in NODEJS using JS.
